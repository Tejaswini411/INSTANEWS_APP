# Learnings
### Sass
SassScript is the scripting language itself.
Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). SassScript is the scripting language itself.
Sass features:

- Nested rules
- Variables
- JS-style comments
- Mixins
- Operations
- Functions

### Ajax

Ajax provides a way to exchange data between the browser and the server without reloading the page.

Ajax is often used when submitting web forms and fetching data from a server, including from third-party APIs.

It's asynchronous because Ajax doesnâ€™t block other events from happening when the request is sent and the client is waiting for a response.

Methods for making Ajax requests:

- .ajax()
- .load()
- .get()
- .post()
- .getJSON()
- .getScript()

Methods for dealing with Ajax responses:

- .done()
- .fail()
- .always()
- .abort()

### Json

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and simply provides a way for us to encode text-based data in a way that's easy to work with.

Ultimately, it gives us a way to encode both simple and more complex data structures (including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, and null) into a format that can easily be transmitted between two points.
